# AI

This is a work in progress, the purpose of which is to showcase my AI coding for my portfolio.

To test, download or (preferably) clone the remote repository to a local git repository.
Then follow the instructions.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR LINUX ENVIRONMENT

-First execute setup.sh, this will decompress and organize the AI training data files.

-Then execute build.sh, which will compile the binary.

-Finally, run the binary called AIbin that was generated by build.sh

Only linux environment is supported for now, but the C++ should compile on others. It might require a bit of legwork (that I haven't done for you yet) to get running though.
